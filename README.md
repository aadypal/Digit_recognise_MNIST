In this project, I have implemented Keras library for CNN based digit recognition model to recognize handwritten digits from a MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset of tens of thousands of images. I have used Libraries:
  Numpy
  Pandas  
  Keras
  Matplotlib
  PyLab
